\# ✈️ AirFly Insights – Data Visualization and Analysis of Airline Operations



\## 📌 Project Overview



AirFly Insights is a data analytics project focused on analyzing airline flight data to understand delay patterns, cancellations, and operational trends.  



The goal of this project is to explore airline performance and uncover meaningful insights using data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization techniques.



This project is part of my learning journey in data analytics and helps me build practical skills in handling real-world datasets.

\## 🎯 Objectives



\- Analyze flight delays and cancellations  

\- Identify trends across airlines, airports, and routes  

\- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  

\- Create derived features for time-based analysis  

\- Prepare data for visualization and dashboarding

\## 📂 Dataset



\- Source: Kaggle Airlines Flights Data  

\- Contains flight information such as airline, origin, destination, delays, and cancellations  

\- Due to large size, sampling and memory optimization were used

\## 🧹 Milestone 1 – Data Cleaning \& Preparation



\### ✔ Tasks Completed



\- Loaded dataset using pandas with sampling  

\- Explored schema, datatypes, and missing values  

\- Converted date columns to datetime format  

\- Filled missing delay values using median  

\- Filled missing cancellation codes with "Not Cancelled"  

\- Filled delay reason columns with 0  

\- Removed duplicate records  

\- Normalized categorical fields  

\- Ensured valid and positive delay values  

\- Created new features:

&nbsp; - Month  

&nbsp; - Day of Week  

&nbsp; - Hour  

&nbsp; - Route (Origin–Destination)  

\- Saved cleaned dataset for reuse
